# Notes

Create a function named divisors/Divisors that takes an integer n > 1 and returns an array with all of the integer's divisors(except for 1 and the number itself), from smallest to largest. If the number is prime return the string '(integer) is prime' (null in C#, empty table in COBOL) (use Either String a in Haskell and Result<Vec<u32>, String> in Rust).

Example:
divisors(12); // should return [2,3,4,6]
divisors(25); // should return [5]
divisors(13); // should return "13 is prime"

## Plans

pomodoro 1:
- âœ… Initial refactor
- âœ… User stories
- âœ… UAT1.1 - When user pass 1, it should return []
- âœ… UAT1.2 - When user pass 4, it should return [2]
- âœ… UAT1.3 - When user pass 6, it should return [2,3]

Pomodoro 2:
- âœ… UAT1.4 - When user pass 8, it should return [2,4]
- âœ… UAT1.5 - When user pass 9, it should return [3]
- âœ… UAT1.6 - When user pass 10, it should return [2,5]
- âœ… UAT1.7 - When user pass 12, it should return [2,3,4,6]
- âœ… UAT2.1 - When user pass 2, it should return '2' is prime'
- âœ… UAT2.2 - When user pass 3, it should return '3' is prime'
- âœ… UAT2.3 - When user pass 5, it should return '5' is prime'
- âœ… UAT2.4 - When user pass 7, it should return '7' is prime'

Pomodoro 3:
- âœ… UAT2.5 - When user pass 11, it should return '11' is prime'
- âœ… UAT2.6 - When user pass 13, it should return '13' is prime'
- âœ… More user stories
- âœ… UAT4.1 - When user pass 25, it should return [5]
- âœ… UAT4.2 - When user pass 27, it should return [3,9]
- âœ… UAT4.3 - When user pass 24, it should return [2,3,4,6,8,12]
- âœ… UAT4.4 - When user pass 33, it should return [3,11]
- ðŸš§ UAT4.5 - When user pass 48, it should return [2,3,4,6,8,12,16,24]
